Simple bash script which implements GUI for FFMPEG.
You can choose popular formats for video and images. There is also few filters that can be added to your output file.

## IMPORTANT! GUI is written in Polish as it was a mini-project for "Operating Systems" subject at my university.

This program needs FFMPEG to be installed first.
