Simple bash script which implements GUI for FFMPEG.
You can choose popular formats for audio, video and image. There is also few filters that can be added to your output file.

## IMPORTANT! GUI is written in Polish as it was a mini-project for "Operating Systems" subject at my university.

This program needs FFMPEG and ImageMagick to be installed first.
